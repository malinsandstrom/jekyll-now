## In which I split myself in two

The best way to learn new tech is to do something fun with it. So, I made myself another GitHub account, shifted all the work stuff over there, and kept my original account for play and learning. 

Project number one will be to set up a blog I am happy with and can easily edit on the go. I am hoping that [Jekyll Now](/ "https://github.com/barryclark/jekyllnow") and Prose.io will be a good start.
